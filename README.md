# Robotic-Arm-Control-2017
This project aims to implement an application that will control the movement of a robotic arm. The first one part is implemented in .NET C # and is a user-friendly GUI that allows users to control every function and movement of the arm and jack. The second part is implemented in microC and is responsible for the smooth and correct operation of the microcontroller that controls the robotic arm.
